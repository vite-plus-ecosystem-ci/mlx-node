/**
 * Server-private `ChatSession` warm-reuse helper.
 *
 * Kept out of the `@mlx-node/lm` package exports entirely so downstream
 * consumers cannot reach it: the module lives inside
 * `@mlx-node/server`, its file path is not on the server's export map,
 * and nothing re-exports it. Callers are the two server endpoints —
 * `endpoints/responses.ts` (tier-1 / tier-2 HIT branch) and
 * `endpoints/messages.ts` (`getOrCreateWarmAny` HIT branch) — each
 * invoking the helper exclusively under a `SessionRegistry` HIT gate.
 *
 * Why this helper exists at all: `ChatSession.reset()` is the safe
 * public wipe — it always calls `model.resetCaches()` because the
 * underlying `SessionCapableModel` is shared across every session
 * lifetime via the native `ModelRegistry`. A partial wipe that leaves
 * the shared native KV cache intact without the HIT gate would leak a
 * previous (unrelated) request's cached prefix into the next
 * `chat_session_start_sync` call. The server's warm-lease replay path
 * DOES have that HIT gate — the registry's own `getOrCreate` hit
 * signal is the authoritative proof that the native cache genuinely
 * belongs to this chain — so a JS-state-only reset that preserves the
 * native cache is correct there and only there.
 *
 * Fields accessed: `inFlight`, `history`, `lastImagesKey`, `lastAudioKey`, `turnCount`,
 * `unresolvedOkToolCallCount`, `needsFullReplay`. These are TypeScript `private` fields on
 * `ChatSession` (compile-time only) — at runtime they are ordinary
 * properties. The cast through {@link ChatSessionWarmReuseInternals}
 * gives this helper a typed view of the instance without relaxing the
 * class's `private` declarations. The field names MUST stay in sync
 * with `packages/lm/src/chat-session.ts`; a mismatch would silently
 * skip the intended state wipe and is covered by the chat-session
 * unit tests that exercise this path through the endpoint handler.
