//! Auto-tuned Metal allocator cache limit + per-session memory hygiene.
//!
//! Python `mlx-lm` caps the Metal allocator's free-pool via
//! `mx.set_wired_limit(...)` at server startup and calls `mx.clear_cache()`
//! every 256 decode steps. We already mirror both of those: `WiredLimitContext`
//! (see `crates/mlx-core/src/stream.rs`) sets the wired limit at model load
//! and the FLAT `DecodeStep::maintain_cache` default (`crates/mlx-core/src/
//! engine/backend.rs`) drains the pool via `clear_cache()` every 256 decode
//! steps inside each generative model. The piece that was still missing was an
//! explicit ceiling on how large the MLX allocator's free-pool may grow
//! between decode loops — on a 128GB M3 Max the default ceiling is the full
//! `max_recommended_working_set_size` (~96GB), so the pool slowly climbs to
//! that value and never drains on an idle process.
//!
//! ## Why a coordinator (not a one-shot function)
//!
//! `set_cache_limit` is a process-wide knob. An MLX-Node server can host
//! multiple generative models simultaneously (`ModelRegistry` has no upper
//! bound on concurrent `register()` calls). A naive
//! `apply_auto_cache_limit(model_bytes)` called from each model's `load()`
//! is a last-write-wins race: loading a small VLM after a big LM would
//! silently shrink the ceiling below the LM's working set.
//!
//! [`CacheLimitCoordinator`] tracks the live per-model deltas contributed
//! by each loaded model. Every call to [`CacheLimitCoordinator::register`]
//! returns a [`CacheLimitGuard`] tied to that model's lifetime. The
//! guard's `Drop` removes the entry and recomputes the ceiling, so
//! unloading one model reshapes the cap without ever leaving the
//! previously-capped value in place for a cold process — an empty
//! coordinator intentionally leaves the last-applied cap alone (nothing
//! to allocate anyway, cap costs nothing).
//!
//! ## Baseline choice: deterministic model-owned weight bytes
//!
//! Each caller passes its own delta computed as
//! `params.values().map(|a| a.nbytes()).sum::<usize>()` — the sum of
//! every weight array the model owns, in bytes. This value is:
//!
//!   - **Deterministic** — a pure function of the checkpoint and dtype
//!     layout, identical on every load.
//!   - **Model-local** — nothing the model does NOT own can contaminate
//!     the number, so there is no interaction with concurrent inference
//!     threads on a process-wide counter.
//!   - **Composable** — deltas sum naturally across models, so loading
//!     two models grows the cap to cover BOTH and unloading one shrinks
//!     it cleanly back to the survivor's footprint.
//!
//! An earlier iteration sampled `get_active_memory()` before/after the
//! load closure and used the delta. That was wrong: `get_active_memory()`
//! is a process-wide counter, so a concurrent inference thread
//! allocating between the before/after samples contaminated the delta
//! with memory that did not belong to the loading model, and the
//! corresponding unregister then shrunk the cap by the wrong amount. A
//! process-wide `LOAD_MUTEX` could serialize loads against each other
//! but could NOT serialize a load against live inference, so the race
//! was structurally unfixable without either blocking all inference
//! across load boundaries or abandoning the active-memory sample.
//! Deterministic weight bytes avoid the problem entirely — nothing in
//! the formula depends on observing process-global state, so there is
//! no race surface.
//!
//! ## Budget-based cap formula
//!
//! Earlier rounds computed the cap as `min(sum(weights) * 7/4, wired *
//! 3/5)`. That expression did NOT model the actual memory budget: the
//! `wired * 3/5` clamp scales only with the machine, not with how much
//! of wired the weights already occupy. Two real failure modes:
//!
//!   - **96 GB wired, 36 GB weights** → `96 * 0.6 = 57.6 GB` cap, peak
//!     memory ≈ `36 + 57.6 + ~10 driver` = 103 GB, which exceeds 96 GB
//!     wired and makes the whole system laggy.
//!   - **48 GB wired, 36 GB weights** → `48 * 0.6 = 28.8 GB` cap, peak
//!     ≈ `36 + 28.8 + ~10` = 75 GB → OOM, the model literally can't
//!     run.
//!
//! The new formula subtracts what is NOT the freelist from wired and
//! gives the remainder to MLX:
//!
//! ```text
//! cap = wired - weights - overhead - headroom      (if positive)
//!     = MIN_FREELIST_BYTES (1 GiB)                 (otherwise)
//! ```
//!
//! where
//!
//!   - **overhead** = `max(4 GiB, wired / 20)` — Metal driver state, MoE
//!     transpose cache, command buffer pool, kernel pipelines. Scales
//!     with system size with a floor for small-RAM hosts.
//!   - **headroom** = `max(4 GiB, wired / 10)` — reserved for macOS and
//!     other apps so the system stays responsive. Overridable via
//!     `MLX_GPU_HEADROOM_GB`.
//!
//! If weights + overhead + headroom already exceed wired (tight-fit
//! territory) we floor the freelist at 1 GiB so the allocator still
//! has something to reuse — MLX will churn but the model at least
//! runs.
//!
//! When wired is 0 (non-Metal machine or query failed) we fall back to
//! `weights * 3/2`, the same flavour of fixed multiplier as the old
//! formula's baseline term.
//!
//! ## Env overrides (precedence)
//!
//!   1. `MLX_CACHE_LIMIT_GB=N` — hard override, trumps everything. `=0`
//!      skips the call and retains the MLX default.
//!   2. `MLX_GPU_HEADROOM_GB=N` — tunes only the headroom term of the
//!      auto formula. Does NOT affect the overhead term.
//!   3. Otherwise: the budget formula above.
//!
//! ## Cache hygiene (no per-request RAII)
//!
//! An earlier iteration dropped a `ClearCacheOnDrop` guard inside every
//! session command handler. That is wrong on a multi-model server: the
//! allocator's free-pool is process-wide, so flushing after a request on
//! model A discards reusable blocks belonging to model B's next turn.
//! Between-turn draining now lives on the TS side (`@mlx-node/server`'s
//! idle sweeper — drains only when the whole process is idle for
//! `idleClearCacheMs`). The decode-loop `clear_cache()` fired every 256
//! steps is untouched.
