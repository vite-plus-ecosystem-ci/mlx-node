//! Stress test for the C++-side paged-attention dispatch.
//!
//! `PagedKVWrite::eval_gpu` and `PagedAttention::eval_gpu` encode their
//! kernels onto MLX's own `metal::CommandEncoder` (via
//! `crates/mlx-sys/src/mlx_paged_dispatch.cpp`) rather than the extern-C
//! shim into the mlx-paged-attn Rust crate's separate command queue. This
//! test stresses that integration:
//!
//! - Build a graph that interleaves paged ops with standard MLX ops:
//!   `q' = q + bias` (non-paged op),
//!   `(k', v') = paged_kv_write(...)` (paged in-place write),
//!   `attn = paged_attention(q', k', v', ...)` (paged read of
//!   just-written data — exercises the encoder's `set_output_array` →
//!   `set_input_array` fence), then `out = attn + attn` (non-paged op
//!   consuming `attn`).
//!
//! - Run the graph N times with IDENTICAL inputs.
//!
//! - Assert each run is byte-equal to a SYNCHRONOUS REFERENCE output
//!   computed with an explicit `eval()` between the write and the
//!   read. The eval boundary is a hard sync barrier — Metal's queues
//!   drain to completion before host code continues, so the
//!   reference's read necessarily sees the fully-written K/V. This is
//!   the known-good answer; it can't be tainted by a missing fence.
//!
//! - Assert each run DIFFERS from a NO-WRITE BASELINE computed by
//!   running the same attention graph against a zero-initialized
//!   pool with no preceding write. A broken write→read fence might
//!   deterministically schedule the read before the write completes
//!   and read all-zero K/V on every iteration — that pattern would
//!   pass a naive determinism check while being silently wrong. The
//!   non-equality assertion against the no-write baseline rejects it.
//!
//! - Cover BOTH the V1 and V2 paged_attention kernel paths. The
//!   underlying dispatcher picks V1 for `max_context_len <= 512` and
//!   V2 (partitioning + reduce pass + auxiliary-buffer allocation)
//!   for longer sequences. V2's two-kernel chain has a strictly
//!   larger fence surface than V1's single dispatch — both must
//!   honor the write→read fence and the partition-output→reduce-input
//!   fence.
//!
//! ## Why we use byte-equal-to-reference rather than `MLX_GPU_VERIFY=1`
//!
//! Searching MLX for `GPU_VERIFY` returns no hits — there is no env
//! var of that name in this MLX version. The "byte-equal to
//! synchronously-computed reference" check is a strict superset of
//! what `MLX_GPU_VERIFY` would verify: any race-induced divergence
//! (corrupted kernel output, stale read, mid-kernel write tear)
//! surfaces as differing bytes between the run and the reference.
//!
//! ## Skip behavior
//!
//! Skips on hosts without Metal (the underlying C++ dispatch checks
//! `mlx::core::metal::is_available()`).
