# MLX-Node: High-Performance ML Framework for Node.js

MLX-Node brings Apple's MLX library to Node.js with Metal GPU acceleration through a Rust/NAPI/C++ bridge. It supports inference (Qwen3, Qwen3.5, Gemma4, LFM2.5), training (GRPO, SFT), vision-language models, document processing (PaddleOCR-VL, PP-\* pipelines), and embeddings (Harrier).

## References

### MLX Source (Single Source of Truth)

`crates/mlx-sys/mlx` is a **symlink** to `/Users/brooklyn/workspace/github/mlx` — NOT a git submodule. All MLX C++ changes, including the WebGPU backend, are made in `/Users/brooklyn/workspace/github/mlx` and automatically picked up by the WASM build. Never re-initialize this as a submodule. The symlink is in `.gitignore`.

There are already some wild used inference implementations for your reference:

- ./mlx-lm, the MLX inference Python library from the official MLX team
- ./mlx-vlm, the MLX vision-language model inference library, more active maintenance
- ~/workspace/github/vllm, the state of art inference library, mostly optimized for CUDA/ROCm but we borrow a lot of paged attention design from it. Widely used in server production environments.

## Build, test, lint

```bash
# Build
yarn build                                       # native + TS
yarn build:native                                # Rust/NAPI native addon (~70s incremental)
yarn build:ts                                    # tsc -b across packages
yarn typecheck                                   # TS type-check only
cargo build --release -p mlx-tui                 # mlx-train TUI binary

# Test
yarn vite run test                               # all TS tests
yarn vitest __test__/path/to.test.ts             # single TS test
cargo test -p mlx-core                           # Rust unit tests
cargo test -p mlx-paged-attn                     # paged-attention tests

# Lint & format
yarn vite fmt                                    # Oxfmt via Vite+
yarn vite lint --type-aware --type-check         # Oxlint with type checking
cargo clippy --all --fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged
cargo fmt

# Scripts
oxnode <file.ts>                                 # run a TS file (NOT tsx)
```

`yarn build:native` is the canonical native build — running `cargo build` directly does **not** produce the `.node` addon.

## Imports

```typescript
// Inference + chat sessions
import {
  Qwen3Model,
  Qwen35Model,
  Qwen35MoeModel,
  Gemma4Model,
  Lfm2Model,
  loadModel,
  loadSession,
  ChatSession,

} from '@mlx-node/lm';

// Training
import { GRPOTrainer, GRPOTrainerConfig, SFTTrainer, SFTTrainerConfig } from '@mlx-node/trl';

// Vision + document processing
import {
  VLModel,
  QianfanOCRModel,
  StructureV3Pipeline,
  DocLayoutModel,
  TextDetModel,
  TextRecModel,
  DocOrientationModel,
  DocUnwarpModel,
} from '@mlx-node/vlm';

// Streaming chat via ChatSession
const session = await loadSession('./model-path');
for await (const event of session.sendStream('Hello!')) {
  if (!event.done) process.stdout.write(event.text);
}
```

## Known limitations

- macOS only (Metal backend, Apple Silicon)
- No CUDA support
- Compiled C++ forward paths use process-wide globals (serialized via `std::sync::Mutex` + `RwLock` in `crates/mlx-core/src/models/qwen3_5/model.rs`)

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, but it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`.

## Vite+ Workflow

`vp` is a global binary that handles the full development lifecycle. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

### Start

- create - Create a new project from a template
- migrate - Migrate an existing project to Vite+
- config - Configure hooks and agent integration
- staged - Run linters on staged files
- install (`i`) - Install dependencies
- env - Manage Node.js versions

### Develop

- dev - Run the development server
- check - Run format, lint, and TypeScript type checks
- lint - Lint code
- fmt - Format code
- test - Run tests

### Execute

- run - Run monorepo tasks
- exec - Execute a command from local `node_modules/.bin`
- dlx - Execute a package binary without installing it as a dependency
- cache - Manage the task cache

### Build

- build - Build for production
- pack - Build libraries
- preview - Preview production build

### Manage Dependencies

Vite+ automatically detects and wraps the underlying package manager such as pnpm, npm, or Yarn through the `packageManager` field in `package.json` or package manager-specific lockfiles.

- add - Add packages to dependencies
- remove (`rm`, `un`, `uninstall`) - Remove packages from dependencies
- update (`up`) - Update packages to latest versions
- dedupe - Deduplicate dependencies
- outdated - Check for outdated packages
- list (`ls`) - List installed packages
- why (`explain`) - Show why a package is installed
- info (`view`, `show`) - View package information from the registry
- link (`ln`) / unlink - Manage local package links
- pm - Forward a command to the package manager

### Maintain

- upgrade - Update `vp` itself to the latest version

These commands map to their corresponding tools. For example, `vp dev --port 3000` runs Vite's dev server and works the same as Vite. `vp test` runs JavaScript tests through the bundled Vitest. The version of all tools can be checked using `vp --version`. This is useful when researching documentation, features, and bugs.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using the package manager directly:** Do not use pnpm, npm, or Yarn directly. Vite+ can handle all package manager operations.
- **Always use Vite commands to run tools:** Don't attempt to run `vp vitest` or `vp oxlint`. They do not exist. Use `vp test` and `vp lint` instead.
- **Running scripts:** Vite+ built-in commands (`vp dev`, `vp build`, `vp test`, etc.) always run the Vite+ built-in tool, not any `package.json` script of the same name. To run a custom script that shares a name with a built-in command, use `vp run <script>`. For example, if you have a custom `dev` script that runs multiple services concurrently, run it with `vp run dev`, not `vp dev` (which always starts Vite's dev server).
- **Do not install Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt, or tsdown directly:** Vite+ wraps these tools. They must not be installed directly. You cannot upgrade these tools by installing their latest versions. Always use Vite+ commands.
- **Use Vite+ wrappers for one-off binaries:** Use `vp dlx` instead of package-manager-specific `dlx`/`npx` commands.
- **Import JavaScript modules from `vite-plus`:** Instead of importing from `vite` or `vitest`, all modules should be imported from the project's `vite-plus` dependency. For example, `import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus';` or `import { expect, test, vi } from 'vite-plus/test';`. You must not install `vitest` to import test utilities.
- **Type-Aware Linting:** There is no need to install `oxlint-tsgolint`, `vp lint --type-aware` works out of the box.

## CI Integration

For GitHub Actions, consider using [`voidzero-dev/setup-vp`](https://github.com/voidzero-dev/setup-vp) to replace separate `actions/setup-node`, package-manager setup, cache, and install steps with a single action.

```yaml
- uses: voidzero-dev/setup-vp@v1
  with:
    cache: true
- run: vp check
- run: vp test
```

## Review Checklist for Agents

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` and `cargo test` to validate changes.

## Browser Playground Void Scope

This repository uses Void only to deploy the browser playground as a prebuilt static SPA. Do not convert the playground into a fullstack Void app, do not add `voidPlugin()` to `packages/browser/vite.config.ts`, and do not add `routes/`, `pages/`, `db/`, or `env.ts` unless the task explicitly asks for a backend feature.

The browser deploy path is:

```bash
yarn workspace @mlx-node/browser build
yarn workspace @mlx-node/browser deploy:void
```

`packages/browser/void.json` pins the static SPA output directory and the COOP/COEP/CORP headers required by SharedArrayBuffer and WebGPU workers. Keep it in sync with `packages/browser/demo/public/_headers`, which is emitted into the built `dist` for static hosts that read `_headers`.

The local model symlink under `packages/browser/demo/public/model` is a development-only convenience and must not be included in `packages/browser/dist`. The browser build emits only the Vite bundle, `capybara.png`, `_headers`, and the prebuilt WASM artifact from `packages/core/mlx-core.wasm32-wasi.opt.wasm`.

## Void

This project uses [Void](https://void.cloud) — a fullstack Vite plugin + deployment platform for Cloudflare. `voidPlugin()` in `vite.config.ts` gives you file-based API routing on Hono (`routes/`), Inertia-inspired server-rendered pages with co-located loaders/actions (`pages/` + `@void/vue` or `@void/react`), auto-provisioned D1/KV/R2 bindings, first-class Drizzle ORM integration (schema in `db/schema.ts` -> `void/db` Drizzle instance -> typed routes -> typed fetch client), built-in auth, queues, cron jobs, edge caching (ISR), and one-command deploys via `npx void deploy`. For first-time setup, prefer `npx void init`; in an empty directory, install `void` first and let the interactive flow scaffold the starter, add the matching framework adapter, configure project files, handle auth, and link or create the deploy project before the first deploy. In an existing app, `void init` configures Void in place by adding missing Vite scripts and creating or patching `vite.config.*` with `voidPlugin()`. Use `void` and `@void/*` package names in source code and package manifests.

Database: define Drizzle tables in `db/schema.ts`, import `db` from `void/db` and tables from `@schema`. Use `void db push` for prototyping, `void db generate` for production migrations. `drizzle-orm` and `drizzle-kit` ship with void (no extra install). Migrations live in `db/migrations/`.

Env: declare every env key in `env.ts` at the project root via `defineEnv({ KEY: string(), ... })` from `void/env`. Read values via `import { env } from "void/env"`. Schema validation runs at dev start (warns) and on `void deploy` (hard error on missing prod secrets). Use `VITE_*` prefix for keys that should be exposed to client code.

CI/editor prep: run `void prepare` to generate `.void/routes.d.ts`, `.void/db.d.ts`, `.void/queues.d.ts`, `.void/env.d.ts`, and `.void/tsconfig.json` without booting Vite. Run it after `npm install` in CI or a fresh clone before typechecking; `vite dev` and `vite build` regenerate these during normal workflows.

Rewrites and redirects: declare static rules in `void.json` under `routing.redirects` / `routing.rewrites` / `routing.fallbacks`, or in a `public/_redirects` file. For dynamic rewrites, call `c.rewrite(path)` in a `defineMiddleware`.

Logs: surface app-level errors that should show up under `void project logs --level error` via `import { logger } from "void/log"` and `logger.error(msg, fields?)` (also `.warn` / `.info`). Anything caught and only persisted to your own DB is invisible to Cloudflare Tail; route it through `logger.*` or `console.*` so the platform can see it.

Full docs are in `node_modules/void/docs/`. If you have the `void` skill available, use it for a complete API reference covering project structure, routing, pages mode, database, auth, typed fetch, KV, storage, queues, cron jobs, CLI, configuration, and deployment.
